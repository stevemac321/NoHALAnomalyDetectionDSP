**BareBones Signal Inference â€“ STM32 CMSIS Build**

This minimal build demonstrates a single-signal inference pipeline on STM32, built with CMSIS DSP and NanoEdge AI. No HAL, no Cube glue â€“ just precision control and performance.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- Voltage input signal only
- CMSIS DSP for lightweight filtering and preprocessing
- NanoEdge AI for embedded inference
- Direct register access â€“ no HAL dependencies
See the more full featured HAL version https://github.com/stevemac321/NanoEdge_DSP for more details.
